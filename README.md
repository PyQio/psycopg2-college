# psycopg2-college
This was an assignment given by my Database course's professor, where we had to work with the Psycopg2 module on Python. This was also my first time working with Python and I couldn't use either any external module or more than one file (script.py).

As you can probably tell, there are many things that could have been done differently or better, but I'm quite proud of the final results, so I decided to create this repository and maybe work on this project once I will have some spare time! 

Please don't cringe on my errors programming :)
